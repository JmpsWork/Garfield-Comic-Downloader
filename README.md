# Garfield-Comic-Downloader
This was a mini-project by me to see if I could efficiently download every Garfield comic that exists. You can use this for whatever you want.

To make this work, just create a folder in the same directory this .py file is in, and then name it "garfield". It will then download all comics in an ordered fashion. With every new year, a folder is created with that year name, and with every month it will create a new folder for that. All the comics are downloaded in the .gif format.
