# Garfield-Comic-Downloader
This was a mini-project by me to see if I could efficiently download every Garfield comic that exists. You can use this for whatever you want.

To make this work, just create a folder in the same directory this .py file is in, and then name it "garfield". It will then download all comics in an ordered fashion. With every new year, a folder is created with that year name, and with every month it will create a new folder for that. All the comics are downloaded in the .gif format.
Once you run it, just remain patient. It took about an hour for my PC with good internet connection to download all the comics. It might take longer for you.
